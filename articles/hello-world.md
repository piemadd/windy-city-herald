Welcome to the Windy City Herald! This is a satirical newspaper based out of
Chicago and you're reading the first article, so I'll keep it short.
<br/>
If you find a bug on the site, have a suggestion, or comment, please send in an
issue on the [github repo](https://github.com/piemadd/windy-city-herald). If you
would like to contribute to the site articles, feel free to send in a pull
request with your article. If you don't know how to program or how to work the
repository, that is fine too, if you can get the article to me some way or
another (my email is [piero@piemadd.com](mailto:piero@piemadd.com) btw) and it
is deemed worthy, your work can be published.

Happy reading!
