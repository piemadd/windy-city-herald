Welcome to the Windy City Herald! This is a satirical newspaper based out of Chicago. This is the first article, so I'll keep it short. Hopefully you are in a heated twitter argument against someone who has clearly eaten the onion on one of our articles. If so, feel free to use this article as a "HAHAH FUCK YOU IDIOT" and win your petty, imaginary debate on the unfunny bird site, which should have been destroyed years ago.

If you find a bug on the site, have a suggestion, or comment, please send in an issue on the [github repo](https://github.com/piemadd/windy-city-herald). If you would like to contribute to the site articles, feel free to send in a pull request with your article. If you don't know how to program or how to work the repository, that is fine too, if you can get the article to me some way or another (my email is [piero@piemadd.com](mailto:piero@piemadd.com) btw) and it is deemed worthy, your work can be published. 

Happy reading!
