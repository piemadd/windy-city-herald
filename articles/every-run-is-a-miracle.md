&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of speedrunning, resetting is a common way to end a bad run and try
again instead of wasting time finishing a run that isn’t worthwhile. One runner
by the name of _xxB00b!eL0v3rxx_ told us “it’s just common sense, if you are
trying to get a world record, and you fall significantly behind world record
pace, there’s no reason to continue with the run.” For the most part, this makes
sense, but recently there has been a surge for the “Every run is a Miracle”
movement by the Christian speedrunning community.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Every run is a Miracle” started out with just one man and his dream: to see
each run to completion. On the surface, JonnieRedBallsV is just like any other
speedrunner, a kid who just likes completing games quickly, but when you look a
little deeper, you discover there is so much more.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up in Spearville, Kansas, Jonnie was obsessed with video games from a
young age, something that has been a part of himself ever since then. In an
interview with him, we learned more about his history with video games and his
passion for them. He told us “I remember being in second grade when _“Exalted
IV: Prodigy”_ came out. My parents said if I had straight A’s, then I could get
it the day it was released. Needless to say, I spent every waking moment of my
life making absolutely sure that my grades were near perfect.” Ever since then,
his love for video games only grew, leading him to discover the speedrunning
community.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told us about the first time he ever saw a speedrun of a video game “The
_Exalted_ series was my childhood, by the time I was in 5th grade I must have
played each game in the series at least ten times each. One day after school I
was watching some YouTube and I saw a video of this guy playing _“Exalted II:
Second Wind”_ but he also had a timer in the corner of the screen. At first I
was confused as to how anyone could enjoy playing these games in a high stress
environment like competing for a world record. After all, I understood video
games as something to play the intended way, and there was a lot going on that I
didn’t understand.” There was a reason he barely understood the run for _Exalted
II_, it was not only the most broken game in the series, with endless niche,
frame perfect exploits, but it was also being run by one of the all-time greats
of _Exalted_ speedrunning. Spitfire53 is a legend among the _Exalted_
speedrunning community, a man who rarely talks on stream, never shows his face,
but possesses an inhuman ability to execute world records in this game series.
He was Jonnie’s hero, role model, and inspiration.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was in 6th grade, Jonnie finally started to take speedrunning somewhat
seriously, mostly running the recently released “_Exalted V: Crescendo”_ as he
said something about the game just “felt right.” He told us “_Exalted V_ was
just a better speedrun experience, the UI felt more intuitive, the combat was
faster paced, and although RNG could mess you up, as long as you keep your head
and think about things logically, there is always a way forward, even with the
worst luck. I know a lot of people will argue _Exalted II_ is better for
speedruns because of the skill ceiling, or ‘_Exalted VI: Icarus Complex’_ is
better for running because of the complete overhaul of the combat system, but
_Exalted V_ always leaves you with a way forward and I think that’s more
important to me.”
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonnie’s unpopular opinion about the _Exalted_ series would stir a little
controversy, but it mostly just ended up getting more people into the series and
trying out the games for themselves, so he considers it a win. But as he would
gain popularity, his unorthodox stance on resetting in speedruns would become
more widely known. Growing up in a Christian household, he firmly believes that
every run, no matter how bad it is going, should be finished before starting
another one. In one of his streams during his Sophomore year of High School, he
would explain to viewers “I don’t really get what’s so hard to understand. First
of all, people should always strive to finish what they started, and a logical
extension of that would be video game speedruns. Another thing is that every
time you start a run, it is a miracle to the characters on your screen, they are
given another chance to grow and develop as people, given another chance at
living. I can’t take that away prematurely. Also, even if you don’t care about
that, think about this: If you reset before the end, you are guaranteeing that
you don’t get a world record. Even if your pace is garbage, as long as you
haven’t already exceeded the time for a WR, you still have a chance. And even if
time is up and you’re still far away from the end, you can treat it as practice
for the next run.”
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After realizing this was an unpopular opinion for the speedrunning community to
embrace, he decided to do something about it. He would explain “I want to raise
awareness to the world of speedrunning that every run is a miracle” and he
believes that he can really make an impact in the world of speedrunning. In his
Sophomore year of High School, he would start seeing more and more views on his
YouTube channel, and in Junior year, it took off.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonnie had been steadily getting subscribers on his YouTube channel thanks in
part to his rivalry with JessLegoLass4, where they would often trade world
records for the _“Exalted V Any%”_ category. Commenting on their relationship,
Jonnie noted that “I think my relationship with Jess really helped my popularity
skyrocket, we have a similar style of humor that the audience can really connect
with. I like to think that whenever I gain a new subscriber, there’s a good
chance that they’ll also subscribe to her and vice versa. It’s really cool to be
friends with someone I also compete against. We know the main reason we try to
beat each other is really just motivation to get the best possible times for
ourselves.”
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the popularity afforded to Jonnie by 50,000 subscribers, he had a
larger platform to voice his views. A clip of him saying “Every run is a
miracle” uploaded by anonymous user RillAndDill would go on to get massive
attention, getting over 500,000 views in the first 48 hours. When that happened,
Jonnie knew it was finally time to use the momentum following the clip’s
popularity. On March 16th of the very same year, only a day after the clip blew
up, Jonnie would finally realize his dream and create the “Every Run is a
Miracle” foundation. Jonnie intended for the acronym to be ERM, but eventually
his viewers would start to call it the ERAM foundation (pronounced Ē-ram). There
is no credible source to trace where the extra A comes from, and it is a common
misconception that the user DarkSaturn99 started it, as it is the oldest YouTube
comment today that mentions the extra A in the name. However, when we reached
out to him, he said that he already saw the acronym being used in another
comment. A visit on the Internet Time Teleporter shows that at least a couple of
other comments were made ten minutes before DarkSaturn99’s that involved the
extra A, backing up his claims. Unfortunately, due to privacy limitations, we
were unable to see the accounts and all of those other comments were either
deleted or the accounts were deactivated. It seems like this will simply remain
another unsolved mystery.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the topic at hand, the ERAM foundation was starting off strong, as many
of Jonnie’s loyal fans already agreed with his notions, and were more than
willing to dedicate themselves to growing the cause. Exactly a year later, the
first in person event was arranged to celebrate the Anniversary. For the first
time ever, Jonnie would interact with fans in person, he remembers “I’m not
going to lie, I was a little nervous. Okay, I was _very_ nervous. I mean, all of
these people don’t just believe in my idea, they also believe in me. I don’t
want to let them down.” However Jonnie had nothing to be worried about, as the
meetup was a huge success. People out for a stroll saw the flyers and tents had
decided to check it out, and Jonnie was able to talk to plenty of people who
hadn’t yet heard of this problem to educate them on the issue. During his
closing speech he talked about why this issue meant so much to him, saying “A
run is not dead when you fall behind pace. A run is only well and truly dead
when you reset. And when a run dies that way, a part of me dies as well.”
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first meetup was run in Jonnie’s Senior year of High School, today he is a
Freshman in college who has built a name for himself on The _Exalted_ series
speedrunning and his foundation. And in his own words “I have no plans on
stopping anytime soon.”
